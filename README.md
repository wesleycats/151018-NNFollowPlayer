# NeuralNetworkFollowPlayer
An AI that learns how to follow the player by using a neural network in Unity.

## Features
- [Neural Network](https://github.com/wesleycats/151018-NNFollowPlayer/blob/master/MachineLearning/Assets/Scripts/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.cs)

## Software Anaylse
A neural network can be written in many different programming languages, so I could use multiple game engines like Unreal Engine 4, Unity, CryEngine, Frostbite and many more. 

However, because I don't have alot of time and I need a small demo game to show off the neural network, I'll use an demo I've already made in Unity so I can focus on the neural network.

## Learn goals 
- I want to learn how neural networks are written
- I want to learn how neural networks work
- I want to learn how neural networks are implemented

## Planning 
*Week 1:*

Monday - Research (What is a neural network and how does it work?)

Tuesday - Research (How to create a neural network?)

Wednesday - Research (How to create a neural network?)

Thursday - Creating neural network in Unity

Friday - Creating neural network in Unity

*Week 2:*

Monday - Polish the program (make it user-friendly) + put the program on portfolio

Tuesday - Research for next assignment

Wednesday - Hand in code + write reflection

Thursday - Research for next assignment

Friday - Hand in reflection
